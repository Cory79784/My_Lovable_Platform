================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: An expense tracker with categories and monthly reports

================================== Ai Message ==================================

To create an expense tracker with categories and monthly reports, we will design a Python application that allows users to add expenses, categorize them, and generate monthly reports. We'll use Python's `dataclasses` for structured data management and `pytest` for testing. Here's a breakdown of the core components:

1. **Expense**: A class to represent an individual expense.
2. **Category**: A class to represent a category of expenses.
3. **ExpenseTracker**: A class to manage expenses and categories, and generate reports.
4. **ReportGenerator**: A class to generate monthly reports.
5. **main**: The entry point of the application.
6. **tests**: A directory containing test cases for the application.

Let's start by defining the files and their contents.

### File Structure

- `src/expense.py`
- `src/category.py`
- `src/expense_tracker.py`
- `src/report_generator.py`
- `src/main.py`
- `tests/test_expense.py`
- `tests/test_category.py`
- `tests/test_expense_tracker.py`
- `tests/test_report_generator.py`
- `requirements.txt`

### Implementation

#### src/expense.py
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import date

@dataclass
class Expense:
    """Represents an individual expense."""
    amount: float
    category: str
    date: date
    description: str
```

#### src/category.py
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Category:
    """Represents a category of expenses."""
    name: str
    description: str
```

#### src/expense_tracker.py
```python
from typing import List
from datetime import date
from src.expense import Expense
from src.category import Category

class ExpenseTracker:
    """Manages expenses and categories, and generates reports."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.expenses: List[Expense] = []
        self.categories: List[Category] = []

    def add_expense(self, amount: float, category: str, date: date, description: str):
        """Adds a new expense."""
        if not any(cat.name == category for cat in self.categories):
            raise ValueError(f"Category '{category}' does not exist.")
        expense = Expense(amount, category, date, description)
        self.expenses.append(expense)

    def add_category(self, name: str, description: str):
        """Adds a new category."""
        category = Category(name, description)
        self.categories.append(category)

    def get_expenses_by_month(self, year: int, month: int) -> List[Expense]:
        """Returns expenses for a specific month and year."""
        return [expense for expense in self.expenses if expense.date.year == year and expense.date.month == month]
```

#### src/report_generator.py
```python
from typing import List
from src.expense import Expense

class ReportGenerator:
    """Generates monthly reports for expenses."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def generate_monthly_report(expenses: List[Expense]) -> str:
        """Generates a report for the given list of expenses."""
        report_lines = ["Monthly Expense Report:"]
        total_amount = 0.0
        for expense in expenses:
            report_lines.append(f"{expense.date}: {expense.description} - {expense.amount} ({expense.category})")
            total_amount += expense.amount
        report_lines.append(f"Total: {total_amount}")
        return "\n".join(report_lines)
```

#### src/main.py
```python
from datetime import date
from src.expense_tracker import ExpenseTracker
from src.report_generator import ReportGenerator

def main():
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    
    # Add categories
    tracker.add_category("Food", "Expenses for food and groceries")
    tracker.add_category("Transport", "Expenses for transportation")
    
    # Add expenses
    tracker.add_expense(50.0, "Food", date(2023, 10, 1), "Grocery shopping")
    tracker.add_expense(20.0, "Transport", date(2023, 10, 2), "Bus ticket")
    
    # Generate report for October 2023
    expenses_october = tracker.get_expenses_by_month(2023, 10)
    report = ReportGenerator.generate_monthly_report(expenses_october)
    print(report)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### tests/test_expense.py
```python
from datetime import date
from src.expense import Expense

def test_expense_creation():
    expense = Expense(100.0, "Food", date(2023, 10, 1), "Dinner")
    assert expense.amount == 100.0
    assert expense.category == "Food"
    assert expense.date == date(2023, 10, 1)
    assert expense.description == "Dinner"
```

#### tests/test_category.py
```python
from src.category import Category

def test_category_creation():
    category = Category("Food", "Expenses for food and groceries")
    assert category.name == "Food"
    assert category.description == "Expenses for food and groceries"
```

#### tests/test_expense_tracker.py
```python
import pytest
from datetime import date
from src.expense_tracker import ExpenseTracker

def test_add_category():
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    tracker.add_category("Food", "Expenses for food and groceries")
    assert len(tracker.categories) == 1
    assert tracker.categories[0].name == "Food"

def test_add_expense():
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    tracker.add_category("Food", "Expenses for food and groceries")
    tracker.add_expense(50.0, "Food", date(2023, 10, 1), "Grocery shopping")
    assert len(tracker.expenses) == 1
    assert tracker.expenses[0].amount == 50.0

def test_add_expense_invalid_category():
    tracker = ExpenseTracker()
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        tracker.add_expense(50.0, "Invalid", date(2023, 10, 1), "Grocery shopping")
```

#### tests/test_report_generator.py
```python
from datetime import date
from src.expense import Expense
from src.report_generator import ReportGenerator

def test_generate_monthly_report():
    expenses = [
        Expense(50.0, "Food", date(2023, 10, 1), "Grocery shopping"),
        Expense(20.0, "Transport", date(2023, 10, 2), "Bus ticket")
    ]
    report = ReportGenerator.generate_monthly_report(expenses)
    assert "Monthly Expense Report:" in report
    assert "Total: 70.0" in report
```

#### requirements.txt
```
pytest
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
