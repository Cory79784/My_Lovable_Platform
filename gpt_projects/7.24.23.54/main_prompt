 I want you to build a modern personal portfolio website that beautifully showcases my work and achievements.   It should be built using Next.js for the frontend framework and styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern, clean, and responsive design.  The site should include a visually appealing homepage that introduces me, with a large hero section featuring my name, a short tagline describing what I do, and a high-quality image or illustration that represents my personality and work style.   I want smooth scrolling animations, section transitions, and an overall premium aesthetic that makes the portfolio feel like a professional designer built it
